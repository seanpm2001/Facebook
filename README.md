I haven't really been active on Facebook since 2015, and I have no plans on returning. There isn't an alternative platform for me, and I don't really need one.

## Former usage of Facebook

I formerly used Facebook for a combined 3 hours across a few weeks in 2015, until I abandoned it completely.

### Accounts

I had only 1 accounts on Facebook:

- [`Unknown`](https://example.com/)

## Former Instagram usage

I only used Instagram for 1 day, playing with filters, then just completely abandoning it.

## Former Facebook Messenger usage

During my brief time on Facebook, I did use Facebook Messenger for communications.

## GitHub forks

I fork Facebook projects on GitHub for archival purposes.

## Family usage and assistance

I don't use Facebook myself, but I do help family members who use it.

### Account backup attempts

I have never attempted to backup my Facebook account.

## Opposition

I am strongly opposed to the Facebook company.

### Why am I opposed to Facebook?

Y'know, just the obvious reasons:

- Privacy (Data collection, sale, surveillance, tracker)
- Hate speech (promotion of hate speech, bad algorithms, war crimes (inciting a genocide in Myanmar))
- Proprietary (Facebook is proprietary software)
- Plagiarism (Facebook was plagiarized/stolen from the university it was created in)
- Bad user interface (not just flat design, it is also very poorly designed, For example, there is no need for 3 large scrollbars to be within 12 centimeters (300 PPI) horizontally of each other)
- Just not being a very good platform
- Other reasons

### Opposition to the usage of the word meta

I am opposed to the usage of the word 'meta' by Facebook. Meta is too common of a word for usage as a company name, especially in the computer industry. You may notice that I don't refer to Facebook as "Meta" or "Meta Platforms", this is why.

I am strongly opposed to Facebook. See above.

### Opposition to Instagram

I am opposed to Instagram. Since I don't have an account anymore, there is no way for me to even view Instagram posts, since it is a completely walled site. I don't want to use it anyways.

### Opposition to WhatsApp

#### WhatsApp avoidance

| <img alt="WhatsApp Messenger logo failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" src="/WhatsApp.svg" width="256" height="256"/> |

I avoid Facebook entirely. Since WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, I also avoid it. I do not open WhatsApp links, under any circumstance.

### Opposition to Facebook Messenger

### Opposition to Internet.org

| <img alt="Facebook.org logo failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" src="/Internet_org_logo.svg" width="256" height="256"/> |
|---|
| "Internet.org" logo. |

Internet.org is just Facebook desecrating the name of the Internet to impose censorship, restriction, and zero-rating on underdeveloped countries, just trapping their population further into a boring dystopia.
